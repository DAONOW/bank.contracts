# Decentral Bank: Turing-Complete Currency and Banking Blockchain Network

The blockchain's base smart contract system is based on the EOSIO protocol with many customizations, consensus method changes, and new libraries for issuing stablecoins, building defi apps, and true privacy transactions. 

This repository houses the contracts for banking and monetary policy usage of the chain. Current modules in progress are: bond tokens and instruments, UTXO and MimbleWimble tokens, a debt/collateralization framework (CDP), and the network's native staking/consensus token.
